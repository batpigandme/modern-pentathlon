# Modern Pentathlon ü§∫üèäÔ∏èüèáüèÉÔ∏èüî´

Playing around with results from [Union Internationale de Pentathlon
Moderne (UIPM) 2021 Pentathlon World
Championships](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships).

## üì∫ TidyX Episode 69

Ellis and Patrick were kind enough to have me as a guest on their TidyX
screencast to go through most of the code that‚Äôs in this document. You
can see the episode on YouTube here, [**TidyX Episode 69 \| Modern
Pentathlons with Mara Averick**](https://youtu.be/1356s1-as4o).

Here‚Äôs a pretty picture of what it looks like (plus some random graphics
I tossed on top):

OK, on with the story‚Ä¶

## Motivation

### Part 1: I don‚Äôt get it!

The scoring of the modern pentathlon remains utterly inscrutable to me.
You can *kind of* get the gist of it from this article, [Modern
Pentathlon
Scoring](https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/sports-activities/article/modern-pentathlon-scoring/).
But, to be honest, the more I read (including the bulk of the *lengthy*
[UIPM Competition Rules and
Regulations](https://www.uipmworld.org/sites/default/files/uipm_comp_rules_and_reg_2017_a5.pdf)),
the more confused I became.

Nevertheless, I can‚Äôt help but to be fascinated by a sport that consists
of: fencing, swimming, show jumping on a horse you‚Äôve only known for *20
minutes*, and then doing something called a ***LASER RUN*** (which
involves running and shooting targets, and a bunch of other details I
can‚Äôt be bothered with)! The Olympics website has a [one-minute
explainer
video](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/sports/modern-pentathlon/)
that captures the sport in‚Äîwait for it‚Äîone minute! So peep that, if
you‚Äôre curious.

### Part 2: *Nasty* data formatting

In a recent episode of [Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes)
and [Patrick Ward‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick) TidyX Screencast,
[TidyX Episode 64 \| Data Cleaning - Ugly Excel Files Part
1](https://youtu.be/R8LK1SNH9p0), the hosts took on the kind of data I
often encounter when looking for various sports stats in the wild; it‚Äôs
formatted in a way that‚Äôs useful to *someone*, but that someone is *not
me* (or a database, for that matter). This can be particularly galling
when you‚Äôre in a so-close-but-so-far situation‚Äîe.g.¬†they‚Äôre letting you
export it to a familiar format, such as excel, and have all the
different pieces of data, but have smashed it together in such a way
that it‚Äôs a far cry from ‚Äútidy,‚Äù rectangular data.

UIPM indeed lets you export its world championships results data as one
big [Excel
file](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships),
but then you take a peek and it looks like this‚Ä¶

![Screenshot of exported results for UIPM 2021 Pentathlon World
Championships opened in Google Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/hmjc8nU.png)

These are the moments that make you remember the value of domain
expertise. At a glance, I could see that there were multiple pieces of
information in various cells. But, with the exception of the second
column, **Name** (which has the competitor‚Äôs last name and first name in
bold above what I *assume* is some sort of unique identifier number for
the athlete and their date of birth), I had basically no clue what they
were.

## Data detectivery

Before trying to import my data, I wanted to have at least *some* idea
of what they were‚Äîlosing formatting isn‚Äôt going to make things *more*
obvious. Since the data look slightly different to how they were
presented on the website (below, for example, is some of what you‚Äôll see
for [UIPM 2021 World Championship
Results](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships)
if you select **Women** and **Final**), I thought that might provide
some more insight.

![Screenshot of first few records for Women‚Äôs Finals results of UIPM for
2021 World Championship Final Results](https://i.imgur.com/qWgpF0m.png)
Indeed, the multiple headers seem to match up with information that‚Äôs
crammed into single cells in the Excel export. For example the value
under **Fencing** and **Pts** on the website maps to the first number in
the Excel **Fencing** column, and the number in parentheses next to it
in Excel matches with **Fencing** **Pos**. The value of **Fencing**
**Wins** is the same as the first number below the points and position
in the Excel sheet, so I took a guess that the `# V - # D` formatting
indicates the number of victories and defeats (further evidenced by the
fact that the sum of those two numbers is the same, 36, for each
athlete).

OK, we‚Äôre getting somewhere! All of this without even opening the
*160-page* PDF of rules and regulations. Please note that, if you know a
domain expert, *ask them for help*! I do not know any modern
pentathletes (I don‚Äôt even think I know anyone who does all five of the
activities involved‚Äîif that‚Äôs you, hit me up), so I didn‚Äôt have that
option. And, *no*, I *don‚Äôt* want to talk about how much time I spent
figuring out that **PWR Pts** stands for Pentathlon World Ranking
Points, that **MP Points** stands for Modern Pentathlon Points, or that
**HCP** stands for Handicap (this abbreviation is literally *never*
mentioned in the aforementioned 160-pager).

## Data import with {googlesheets4}

Since I don‚Äôt have Excel on this computer (not a flex, just a fact), I
brought the downloaded XLSX file into Google Sheets. So, hooray, we‚Äôll
be using Jenny Bryan‚Äôs newly updated
[{googlesheets4}](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package along
with [{googledrive}](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) for finding the
file by name.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(googledrive)
```

In order to access my Google Sheets and Drive accounts, respectively,
I‚Äôll be using the authorization function from googlesheets4,
[`gs4_auth()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_auth.html),
which allows you to either interactively select a pre-authorized account
in R, or takes you to the browser to generate obtain a new token for
your account. For posterity‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôm also showing the function from
the googledrive package,
[`drive_auth()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_auth.html),
which does the same thing. To learn more about authenticating your
account in an R Markdown document, see the [Non-interactive
auth](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html#sidebar-2-i-just-want-my-rmd-to-render)
article for [{gargle}](https://gargle.r-lib.org/).

``` r
gs4_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
drive_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
```

Now, we‚Äôll get the file with
[`googledrive::drive_get()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_get.html),
and read in the sheet with
[`googlesheets4::read_sheet()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html).

``` r
w_finals_df <- drive_get("Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships") %>%
  read_sheet(sheet = "Women Finals")
#> Auto-refreshing stale OAuth token.
#> ‚úì The input `path` resolved to exactly 1 file.
#> Auto-refreshing stale OAuth token.
#> ‚úì Reading from
#>   "Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships".
#> ‚úì Range ''Women Finals''.
```

And let‚Äôs take a quick peek at what that looks like‚Ä¶

``` r

To see how the cell values turned out, let‚Äôs use
[`glimpse()`](https://pillar.r-lib.org/reference/glimpse.html).

``` r

```

## Time to clean up

OK, first thing‚Äôs first: getting the different pieces of data into their
own columns. To do this, I‚Äôm going to lean heavily on
[`tidyr::separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html).
I‚Äôm quite confident that someone better versed in regular expressions
would be a little less hacky about things, but that‚Äôs just life. I also
like to use
[`janitor::clean_names()`](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/clean_names.html)
with wild-caught data because I loathe dealing with letter cases and
spaces.

``` r
w_mp_finals <- w_finals_df %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate("name", into = c("name", "uipm_id"), sep = "\n") %>%
  separate("uipm_id", into = c("uipm_id", "dob"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("fencing", into = c("fencing_pts", "f_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_pos", "f_rest"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_wins", "f_rest"), sep = " V - ") %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_losses", NA), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("swimming", into = c("swim_pts", "s_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("s_rest", into = c("swim_pos", "swim_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("riding", into = c("riding_pts", "r_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("r_rest", into = c("riding_pos", "riding_score"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("laser_run", into = c("laser_run_pts", "lr_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("lr_rest", into = c("lr_pos", "lr_time"), sep = '\\)\n')

Now that we‚Äôve separated our data out, let‚Äôs use some of the
[`readr::parse_*()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_atomic.html)
functions (handy even when you‚Äôre not reading the data in) to get the
data types right. Using
[`readr::parse_number()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_number.html)
is especially nice when working with numeric data that has any character
in front of or after the numbers themselves. Since we‚Äôre converting
`time_difference` to a number, we can also go ahead and replace the `NA`
in that column with a zero.

``` r
w_mp_finals %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("pts") | ends_with("pos") | starts_with("fencing") | starts_with("riding"), readr::parse_double)) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = readr::parse_number(time_difference)) %>%
  mutate(dob = readr::parse_date(dob, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = replace_na(time_difference, 0)) -> w_mp_finals

If I had a sense of what I might do with them, I would probably use
[`lubridate::duration()`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/duration.html)
and/or its related family of functions to deal with `swim_time`,
`lr_time`, and `time_difference`. This is helpful because time-math is
funky, and it‚Äôs easy to forget what you‚Äôre dealing with when you‚Äôve got
minutes, seconds, *and* decimals in the mix. Actually, let‚Äôs take a
quick look at the laser-run time (`lr_time`) and `time_difference`
variables to see how the positions in the laser run can be different to
the overall rank even though the athletes cross the finish line in the
order of the final rankings.

(Sidenote: I‚Äôm being a *little* sketchy in my intermediary variables
below, as I temporarily use `lr_secs` to denote the seconds portion of
the total time, and then ultimately use the same name to denote the
final laser-run time in seconds. Because I‚Äôm playing things loose with
that, I‚Äôm keeping the original character-encoded time by using
`remove = FALSE` in my first `separate()` call).

``` r

  separate(lr_time, into = c("lr_mins", "lr_secs"), sep = ":", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(lr_mins = lubridate::dminutes(as.numeric(lr_mins))) %>%

  mutate(lr_secs = lr_mins + lr_secs) %>%
  mutate(finish_time = lr_secs + time_difference) %>%

Huh! Now that I look at it this way, it seems that I *still* don‚Äôt
understand how that last part works. Clearly I need to go back and
review the rules and regulations of the Modern Pentathlon.

If we had any doubts about my misunderstanding the way that the time
difference plays into the final ranking, the men‚Äôs finals make it clear
that I am most definitely wrong. üò¨

What makes me so sure? Well, given they‚Äôre supposed to cross the finish
line in the order of their ranking, `finish_time` would go lowest to
highest/match the order of `rank`, below.

``` r
m_mp_finals %>%
  select(c(rank, lr_pos, lr_time, time_difference, finish_time))
#> # A tibble: 36 x 5

For a quick sanity check, let‚Äôs make sure that the points for the
individual events (the variables with the `_pts` suffixes) add up to
`mp_points`. This could be *a bit* off, due to various penalties in the
rules and regulations that, theoretically, might be deducted from the
final score and not from an individual event. But that should be an
anomaly.

``` r
m_mp_finals %>%
  select(c(rank, ends_with("_pts"), mp_points)) %>%
