# Modern Pentathlon  🤺🏊️🏇🏃️🔫

Playing around with results from [Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) 2021 Pentathlon World Championships](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships).

## Motivation

### Part 1: I don't get it!

The scoring of the modern pentathlon remains utterly inscrutable to me. You can _kind of_ get the gist of it from this article, [Modern Pentathlon Scoring](https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/sports-activities/article/modern-pentathlon-scoring/). But, to be honest, the more I read (including the bulk of the _lengthy_ [UIPM Competition Rules and Regulations](https://www.uipmworld.org/sites/default/files/uipm_comp_rules_and_reg_2017_a5.pdf)), the more confused I became.

Nevertheless, I can't help but to be fascinated by a sport that consists of: fencing, swimming, show jumping on a horse you've only known for _20 minutes_, and then doing something called a _LASER RUN_ (which involves running and shooting targets, and a bunch of other details I can't be bothered with)! The Olympics website has a [one-minute explainer video](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/sports/modern-pentathlon/) that captures the sport in--wait for it--one minute! So peep that, if you're curious.

### Part 2: _Nasty_ data formatting

In a recent episode of [Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes) and [Patrick Ward's](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick) TidyX Screencast, [TidyX Episode 64 | Data Cleaning - Ugly Excel Files Part 1](https://youtu.be/R8LK1SNH9p0), the hosts took on the kind of data I often encounter when looking for various sports stats in the wild; it's formatted in a way that's useful to _someone_, but that someone is _not me_ (or a database, for that matter).
This can be particularly galling when you're in a so-close-but-so-far situation--e.g. they're letting you export it to a familiar format, such as excel, and have all the different pieces of data, but have smashed it together in such a way that it's a far cry from "tidy," rectangular data.

UIPM indeed lets you export its world championships results data as one big [Excel file](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships), but then you take a peek and it looks like this…

These are the moments that make you remember the value of domain expertise. At a glance, I could see that there were multiple pieces of information in various cells. But, with the exception of the second column, **Name** (which has the competitor's last name and first name in bold above what I _assume_ is some sort of unique identifier number for the athlete and their date of birth), I had basically no clue what they were. 

## Data detectivery

Before trying to import my data, I wanted to have at least _some_ idea of what they were--losing formatting isn't going to make things _more_ obvious. Since the data look slightly different to how they were presented on the website (below, for example, is some of what you'll see for [UIPM 2021 World Championship Results](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships) if you select **Women** and **Final**), I thought that might provide some more insight.

Indeed, the multiple headers seem to match up with information that's crammed into single cells in the Excel export. For example the value under **Fencing** and **Pts** on the website maps to the first number in the Excel **Fencing** column, and the number in parentheses next to it in Excel matches with **Fencing** **Pos**. The value of **Fencing** **Wins** is the same as the first number below the points and position in the Excel sheet, so I took a guess that the `# V - # D` formatting indicates the number of victories and defeats (further evidenced by the fact that the sum of those two numbers is the same, 36, for each athlete).

OK, we're getting somewhere! All of this without even opening the _160-page_ PDF of rules and regulations. Please note that, if you know a domain expert, _ask them for help_! I do not know any modern pentathletes (I don't even think I know anyone who does all five of the activities involved--if that's you, hit me up), so I didn't have that option.
