# Modern Pentathlon  ü§∫üèäÔ∏èüèáüèÉÔ∏èüî´

Playing around with results from [Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) 2021 Pentathlon World Championships](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships).

## Motivation

### Part 1: I don't get it!

The scoring of the modern pentathlon remains utterly inscrutable to me. You can _kind of_ get the gist of it from this article, [Modern Pentathlon Scoring](https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/sports-activities/article/modern-pentathlon-scoring/). But, to be honest, the more I read (including the bulk of the _lengthy_ [UIPM Competition Rules and Regulations](https://www.uipmworld.org/sites/default/files/uipm_comp_rules_and_reg_2017_a5.pdf)), the more confused I became.

Nevertheless, I can't help but to be fascinated by a sport that consists of: fencing, swimming, show jumping on a horse you've only known for _20 minutes_, and then doing something called a *__LASER RUN__* (which involves running and shooting targets, and a bunch of other details I can't be bothered with)! The Olympics website has a [one-minute explainer video](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/sports/modern-pentathlon/) that captures the sport in&mdash;wait for it&mdash;one minute! So peep that, if you're curious.

### Part 2: _Nasty_ data formatting

In a recent episode of [Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes) and [Patrick Ward's](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick) TidyX Screencast, [TidyX Episode 64 | Data Cleaning - Ugly Excel Files Part 1](https://youtu.be/R8LK1SNH9p0), the hosts took on the kind of data I often encounter when looking for various sports stats in the wild; it's formatted in a way that's useful to _someone_, but that someone is _not me_ (or a database, for that matter).
This can be particularly galling when you're in a so-close-but-so-far situation&mdash;e.g. they're letting you export it to a familiar format, such as excel, and have all the different pieces of data, but have smashed it together in such a way that it's a far cry from "tidy," rectangular data.

UIPM indeed lets you export its world championships results data as one big [Excel file](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships), but then you take a peek and it looks like this‚Ä¶

These are the moments that make you remember the value of domain expertise. At a glance, I could see that there were multiple pieces of information in various cells. But, with the exception of the second column, **Name** (which has the competitor's last name and first name in bold above what I _assume_ is some sort of unique identifier number for the athlete and their date of birth), I had basically no clue what they were. 

## Data detectivery

Before trying to import my data, I wanted to have at least _some_ idea of what they were&mdash;losing formatting isn't going to make things _more_ obvious. Since the data look slightly different to how they were presented on the website (below, for example, is some of what you'll see for [UIPM 2021 World Championship Results](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships) if you select **Women** and **Final**), I thought that might provide some more insight.

Indeed, the multiple headers seem to match up with information that's crammed into single cells in the Excel export. For example the value under **Fencing** and **Pts** on the website maps to the first number in the Excel **Fencing** column, and the number in parentheses next to it in Excel matches with **Fencing** **Pos**. The value of **Fencing** **Wins** is the same as the first number below the points and position in the Excel sheet, so I took a guess that the `# V - # D` formatting indicates the number of victories and defeats (further evidenced by the fact that the sum of those two numbers is the same, 36, for each athlete).

OK, we're getting somewhere! All of this without even opening the _160-page_ PDF of rules and regulations. Please note that, if you know a domain expert, _ask them for help_! I do not know any modern pentathletes (I don't even think I know anyone who does all five of the activities involved&mdash;if that's you, hit me up), so I didn't have that option. And, _no_, I _don't_ want to talk about how much time I spent figuring out that **PWR Pts** stands for Pentathlon World Ranking Points, that **MP Points** stands for Modern Pentathlon Points, or that **HCP** stands for Handicap (this abbreviation is literally _never_ mentioned in the aforementioned 160-pager).

## Data import with {googlesheets4}

Since I don't have Excel on this computer (not a flex, just a fact), I brought the downloaded XLSX file into Google Sheets. So, hooray, we'll be using Jenny Bryan's newly updated [{googlesheets4}](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package along with [{googledrive}](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) for finding the sheet by name. 

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(googledrive)
```

In order to access my Google Sheets and Drive accounts, respectively, I'll be using the authorization function from googlesheets4, [`gs4_auth()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_auth.html), which allows you to either interactively select a pre-authorized account in R, or takes you to the browser to generate obtain a new token for your account. For posterity's sake, I'm also showing the function from the googledrive package, [`drive_auth()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_auth.html), which does the same thing. To learn more about authenticating your account in an R Markdown document, see the [Non-interactive auth](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html#sidebar-2-i-just-want-my-rmd-to-render) article for [{gargle}](https://gargle.r-lib.org/).  

```{r gs4-auth}
gs4_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
drive_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
```

Now, we'll get the file with [`googledrive::drive_get()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_get.html), and read in the sheet with [`googlesheets4::read_sheet()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html).  

```{r import-data}
w_finals_df <- drive_get("Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships") %>%
  read_sheet(sheet = "Women Finals")
```

And let's take a quick peek at what that looks like‚Ä¶

```{r raw-data}
w_finals_df
```
To see how the cell values turned out, let's use [`glimpse()`](https://pillar.r-lib.org/reference/glimpse.html).

```{r glimpse-raw}
glimpse(w_finals_df)
```

## Time to clean up

OK, first thing's first: getting the different pieces of data into their own columns. To do this, I'm going to lean heavily on [`tidyr::separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html). I'm quite confident that someone better versed in regular expressions would be a little less hacky about things, but that's just life. I also like to use [`janitor::clean_names()`](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/clean_names.html) with wild-caught data because I loathe dealing with letter cases and spaces.

```{r clean-data}
w_mp_finals <- w_finals_df %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate("name", into = c("name", "uipm_id"), sep = "\n") %>%
  separate("uipm_id", into = c("uipm_id", "dob"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("fencing", into = c("fencing_pts", "f_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_pos", "f_rest"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_wins", "f_rest"), sep = " V - ") %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_losses", NA), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("swimming", into = c("swim_pts", "s_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("s_rest", into = c("swim_pos", "swim_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("riding", into = c("riding_pts", "r_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("r_rest", into = c("riding_pos", "riding_score"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("laser_run", into = c("laser_run_pts", "lr_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("lr_rest", into = c("lr_pos", "lr_time"), sep = '\\)\n')

w_mp_finals
```

```{r glimpse-clean}
glimpse(w_mp_finals)
```

Now that we've separated our data out, let's use some of the [`readr::parse_*()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_atomic.html) functions (handy even when you're not reading the data in) to get the data types right. Using [`readr::parse_number()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_number.html) is especially nice when working with numeric data that has any character in front of or after the numbers themselves. Since we're converting `time_difference` to a number, we can also go ahead and replace the `NA` in that column with a zero.

```{r format-results}
w_mp_finals %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("pts") | ends_with("pos") | starts_with("fencing") | starts_with("riding"), readr::parse_double)) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = readr::parse_number(time_difference)) %>%
  mutate(dob = readr::parse_date(dob, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = replace_na(time_difference, 0)) -> w_mp_finals

glimpse(w_mp_finals)
```

If I had a sense of what I might do with them, I would probably use [`lubridate::duration()`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/duration.html) and/or its related family of functions to deal with `swim_time`, `lr_time`, and `time_difference`. This is helpful because time-math is funky, and it's easy to forget what you're dealing with when you've got minutes, seconds, _and_ decimals in the mix. Actually, let's take a quick look at the laser-run time (`lr_time`) and `time_difference` variables to see how the positions in the laser run can be different to the overall rank even though the athletes cross the finish line in the order of the final rankings. 

(Sidenote: I'm being a _little_ sketchy in my intermediary variables below, as I temporarily use `lr_secs` to denote the seconds portion of the total time, and then ultimately use the same name to denote the final laser-run time in seconds. Because I'm playing things loose with that, I'm keeping the original character-encoded time by using `remove = FALSE` in my first `separate()` call).

```{r duration-stuff}
w_mp_finals %>%
  separate(lr_time, into = c("lr_mins", "lr_secs"), sep = ":", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(lr_mins = lubridate::dminutes(as.numeric(lr_mins))) %>%
  mutate(across(c("lr_secs", "time_difference"), lubridate::dseconds)) %>%
  mutate(lr_secs = lr_mins + lr_secs) %>%
  mutate(finish_time = lr_secs + time_difference) %>%
  select(-lr_mins) -> w_mp_finals
  
glimpse(w_mp_finals)
```

Huh! Now that I look at it this way, it seems that I _still_ don't understand how that last part works. Clearly I need to go back and review the rules and regulations of the Modern Pentathlon.

To show you what this would all look like in one _long_ series of pipes, I'll use the results from the same Excel file for the _Men's_ finals. (Caution: A series of pipes this long is likely hazardous to your health...also, you shouldn't copy and paste this much code in real life).

```{r mens-finals}
m_mp_finals <- drive_get("Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships") %>%
  read_sheet(sheet = "Men Finals") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate("name", into = c("name", "uipm_id"), sep = "\n") %>%
  separate("uipm_id", into = c("uipm_id", "dob"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("fencing", into = c("fencing_pts", "f_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_pos", "f_rest"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_wins", "f_rest"), sep = " V - ") %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_losses", NA), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("swimming", into = c("swim_pts", "s_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("s_rest", into = c("swim_pos", "swim_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("riding", into = c("riding_pts", "r_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("r_rest", into = c("riding_pos", "riding_score"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("laser_run", into = c("laser_run_pts", "lr_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("lr_rest", into = c("lr_pos", "lr_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("pts") | ends_with("pos") | starts_with("fencing") | starts_with("riding"), readr::parse_double)) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = readr::parse_number(time_difference)) %>%
  mutate(dob = readr::parse_date(dob, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = replace_na(time_difference, 0)) %>%
  separate(lr_time, into = c("lr_mins", "lr_secs"), sep = ":", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(lr_mins = lubridate::dminutes(as.numeric(lr_mins))) %>%
  mutate(across(c("lr_secs", "time_difference"), lubridate::dseconds)) %>%
  mutate(lr_secs = lr_mins + lr_secs) %>%
  mutate(finish_time = lr_secs + time_difference) %>%
  select(-lr_mins)

glimpse(m_mp_finals)  
```

If we had any doubts about my misunderstanding the way that the time difference plays into the final ranking, the men's finals make it clear that I am most definitely wrong. üò¨

```{r}
m_mp_finals %>%
  select(c(rank, lr_pos, lr_time, time_difference, finish_time))
```
